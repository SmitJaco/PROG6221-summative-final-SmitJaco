Overview
This is a WPF-based GUI chatbot application developed for PROG6221 Part 3. Building on Parts 1 and 2, it implements enhanced features including task management with reminders, a cybersecurity quiz, advanced natural language processing (NLP), and an activity log. The project meets all Part 3 requirements and is designed for an interactive user experience.

Features
Task Management with Reminders:
Add tasks with titles, descriptions, and reminder dates/times.
Display and manage a task list with options to mark as complete or delete.
Cybersecurity Quiz:
Includes 12 questions in true/false and multiple-choice formats.
Provides immediate feedback with educational tips and tracks scores (out of 12).
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Extends keyword recognition from Parts 1 and 2 to handle full phrases and sentences (e.g., "add reminder update password").
Activity Log / Chat History:
Tracks tasks, reminders, quiz attempts, and conversation topics.
Displays the last 5-10 logs with a "Show More" option for additional entries.
